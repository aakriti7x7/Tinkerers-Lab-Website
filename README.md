# Tinkerer's Lab
Tinkererâ€™s Lab at IIT Patna allows you to build things on your own from scratch. This gives you practical and hands-on experience. The lab is almost entirely student-run. The lack of deadlines and pressure allows you to tinker and develop your ideas with full freedom.


# Project description
We will be creating a fully responsive and dynamic website for Tinkerer's Lab from scratch, using HTML, CSS, and JS with some great design. This will include a Landing page, Projects page, Inventory Page, FAQ page, contact page, Admin/Maintainers page, and Booking Portal.  
More content about Tinkerer's Lab will be provided with the assigned issues, feel free to contribute without worrying about the content.
